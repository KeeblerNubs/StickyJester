# Meet The Team – Court Announcement (copy/paste ready)

Please welcome **@҉ 𝙍𝙤𝙮𝙖𝙡 ҉ 𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙞𝙨𝙤𝙧**, the newly appointed Advisor to the Monarch. She walks the palace corridors like she owns them, holding a dossier thicker than your excuses for being late. Her discretion is legendary, her judgment sharper than your cheekbones, and her sense of style is so precise it might actually be a weapon.

She has the trust of the Crown, the insight of a strategist, and the patience of someone who has already survived several council meetings without flipping a table. If the realm stays upright, thank her later.

Treat her with respect, or at least pretend you have some. The monarchy does not accept return policies on advisors.

Welcome to the Court, **@҉ 𝙍𝙤𝙮𝙖𝙡 ҉ 𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙞𝙨𝙤𝙧**.
