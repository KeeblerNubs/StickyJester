# Meet The Team – Court Announcement (copy/paste ready)

Hear ye, hear ye—gather your scattered wits and whatever remains of your dignity.
The Court is pleased—and mildly relieved—to announce the arrival of @Queen Kamelot, newly ascended ModBot and sovereign custodian of our collective nonsense.

She moves through these halls with the assurance of someone who has already read every secret you thought you hid well. Her dossier is thick enough to qualify as a blunt-force weapon, her judgment carries the precision of a jeweler cutting diamonds, and her elegance… well, it could shame a whole ballroom into silence.

The Crown trusts her implicitly.
The strategists respect her insight.
The council fears her patience—because anyone that calm has absolutely considered regicide at least once.

She is the quiet force that keeps the realm upright, the poised hand that steadies this kingdom when it threatens to list sideways, and the polished blade you won’t see coming if you decide to act a fool.

So offer her respect—not the cheap kind you toss around, but the kind you polish before presenting.
Or at the very least, pretend convincingly. The monarchy is regrettably firm on its no returns policy for advisors.

Welcome to the Court, @Queen Kamelot.
May your reign be graceful, your guidance steady, and your banhammer exquisitely aimed.
